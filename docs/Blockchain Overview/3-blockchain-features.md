# Features

Blockchain technology is used in the implementation of cyrptocurrencies. The two most popular coins are Ethereum and Bitcoin.  As of this writing there are 14,947 coins tracked on 1,162 exchanges.  Although Ethereum and Bitcoin are both implemented on blockchains they differ in protocols.  The features described here are those that are common to all blockchains.

* Decentralized network of computers
* Transactions are stored in blocks
* Blocks contain a timestamp
* Each block references a cryptographic hash of the previous block
* The blocks create a ledger of transactions
* Data and the order of the data is verified by consensus protocols 
* Consensus is met by validation of the data by the majority of nodes
* Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are the most used protocols
* Data immutability means that once data is added to the blockchain it cannot be changed
* Data immutability contributes to security and integrity
* Since each successive block references the previous block using a cryptographic hash of the transaction, it would be costly to change data and update all successive blocks
* Data transparency is provided by posting all transaction detail publicly online

## Comparing Consensus Protocols


### Proof of Work (PoW)

Computers, referred to as **miners** compete to solve a brute force attempt to create a low value hash.  The low value hash is a value that starts with 0's.  This takes a lot of computing power.  It isn't good for the environment.  The miner that solves the puzzle first wins and creates the first block. They are rewarded with the cryptocurrency created by creating a block.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

A user "stakes" their own cryptocurrency to be able to validate data and create blocks.  The staked users are randomly chosen to valdiate data and create blocks.  They are rewarded with new currency and fees.  This protocol uses less energy than Proof of Work, and is better for the environment.

### Protocol Security

Traditionally **Proof of Work** was considered more secure, but that is up for debate as many factors contribute to security and maintaining a decentralized network.

## Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most popular cryptocurrencies. In addition to having a native currency, Ethereum also supports decentralized applications known as dApps, and smart contracts. When Ethereum started it used Proof of Work, but migrated to Proof of Stake.  Proof of Stake is faster and is energy efficient compared to Proof of Work. 

Bitcoin is often referred to as "Gold 2.0" or "digital gold" as it used as a currency that can be transferred, created and stored to accumulate value. Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins.  As of this writing, there are 19,776,187.5 coins. Bitcoin uses a [process that will keep the number below 21 million](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/). 

Using Ethereum dApps and smart contracts, developers can create decentralized applications to support decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).
