# Origin

The blockchain is a decentralized ledger of information built out of a network of independent computers referred to as "nodes".  

The blockchain technology was conceived in the early 1990's. **Stuart Haber** and **W. Scott Stornetta** published a paper describing an architecture for [timestamping digital documents](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00196791).  The goal was to certify when media had been created or changed without modifying the media. The technique for doing this involved building a network of blocks secured by cryptographic algorithms.

In 2009, a paper entitled [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) published under the name **Satoshi Nakamoto** described the implementation of the first blockchain used to create the first cryptocurrency. 

The hallmark of the blockchain is that it doesn't depend on the trust of a single entity. The author, [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto), has not been identified.  The inability to identify the creator of Bitcoin is consistent with blockchain's use of node consensus to validate transactions vs. reliance on a single known entity.
