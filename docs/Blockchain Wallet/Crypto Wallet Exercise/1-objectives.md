# Objectives

We'll start by creating a crypto wallet. The ultimate goal of the exercise is to send **Linea Sepolia** test currency to the wallet. Linea Sepolia is a **faucets** that will send test cryptocurrency to the wallet.  
Before cryptocurrency can be sent, it must be made accessible using [chainid.network](https://chainid.network/) where we will connect the wallet to the faucet network. Once we have made the Linea Sepolia network available to the wallet, we can go to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) to send the test currency to the wallet.

There are many crypto wallets available.  We'll use the [MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/) for this exercise.
