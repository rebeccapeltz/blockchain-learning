# Objectives

Creating a crypto wallet and moving test tokens into it is a good way to begin experiencing a blockchain.  This exercise has two parts:

1. Create a wallet
    * Configure the wallet to use test tokens
    * Connect a network that sends test tokens to the wallet
2. Add test tokens to the wallet
    * Send the test token to the wallet
    * Lookup up transaction on etherscan.io

For this exercise use a wallet and tools available on the web:

1. **Wallet** 
There are many crypto wallets available.  Use the [MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/) for this exercise. MetaMask can be installed on mobile devices or as browser extension.  

2. **Chainlist**  
[Chainlist](https://chainid.network/), a tool made available by [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), to **connect** Linea Sepolia, a testnet for Ethereum development, to the wallet. Chainlist provides a list of **RPCs** (Remote Procedure Calls) that connect wallets to Web3 middleware providers.

3. **Chainlink Faucets**  
[Chainlink Faucets](https://faucets.chain.link/), is another tool made available by [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) to **send** test tokens to the wallet. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network.  Oracle networks create a bridge between a blockchain world and the rest of the world. 

When the transaction is complete and settled you can look up the information about it on [the Sepolia etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).
