# Summary

**Did you complete this in less than 20 minutes?**

It's OK if it took longer.  You should now have a MetaMask wallet with Linea Sepolia Ethereum test tokens in it.  If you've installed the wallet on your mobile device as well as Chrome, you should see your coins in both wallets.  

## Review Learning

These topics were covered in preparation for the exercise:

* Origin of Blockchain 
    * Blockchain technology was conceived in the early 1990s
    * It was intended for timestamping media
    * It emphasized a decentralized system and data immutability
    * Bitcoin was the first implemention of the blockchain technology
    * Bitcoin was described in a paper by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009
* Blockchain data structure
    * Blockchain was compared to a linked list datat structure
    * While there are similarities they are different
    * Linked list uses pointer to link an existing node to the next node added to the list
    * Blockchain references a hash of the data in the previous block
* Blockchain features
    * Decentralized network of computers
    * Transactions stored in blocks
    * The chain is made up of blocks containing lists of transactions
    * Blockchain can be described as a decentralized, immutable ledger of transactions
    * Blockchain relies on consensus mechanisms to validate data rather than trusting a central authority
    * Transparency is a hallmark of the blockchain and all transactions be viewed online by anyone
    * Bitcoin and Ethereum are two popular blockchains
    * Bitcoin uses Proof of Work and Ethereum uses Proof of Stake for achieving consensus
    * In addition to being a crytocurrency Ethereum is a computing network that processes code in dApps and smart contracts
    * Bitcoin is thought of as "Gold 2.0" as it is used to acrue value

## Review Blockchain Wallet Excerise

    * Public and Private keys are mathematically related and are used to create digital signatures
    * Public keys act as addresses when sending tokens
    * Private keys should never be shared and should be carefully stored
    * Creating a hash is a one way event and it cannot be undone but it is useful to compare two hashes to determine if two sets of data are the same
    * Digital signing is a process in which data is hashed and then the hash and private key are encrypted
    * A digital signature is encrypted using the sender's private key and decrypted using the sender's public key
    * The MetaMask wallet was installed
    * Wallet installation created a public key, a private key and a secret phrase
    * Chainlist was used to connect the Sepolia Linea network to the wallet
    * Chainlink faucets were used to "drip" a small amount of Linea Seplolia cryptocurrency into the wallet
    * Etherscan was used to look up the transaction using the address of the wallet
